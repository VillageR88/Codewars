###Task
"""
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

###Solution
##My
def rental_car_cost(d):
    if d > 0 and d < 3: return (d * 40)
    elif d >= 3 and d < 7: return (d * 40 - 20)
    elif d >= 7: return (d * 40 - 50)
##Codewars recommended
def rental_car_cost(d):
    result = d * 40
    if d >= 7:
        result -= 50
    elif d >= 3:
        result -= 20
    return result
