///Task
/*
Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

    S is misinterpreted as 5
    O is misinterpreted as 0
    I is misinterpreted as 1

The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.
