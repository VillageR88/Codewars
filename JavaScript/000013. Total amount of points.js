/*Zadanie
Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

    if x > y: 3 points (win)
    if x < y: 0 points (loss)
    if x = y: 1 point (tie)

We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

    our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
    0 <= x <= 4
    0 <= y <= 4

  else if (Number(i.split(":")[0]) == Number(i.split(":")[1])) result += 1;

  return result;
