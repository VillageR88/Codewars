///Task
/*
My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

    Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
    Multiply each number by itself.
    Add them all together.
    Take the square root of the result.
    Divide by two.

Example

predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86

Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.

///Solution
//My
const predictAge = (age1, age2, age3, age4, age5, age6, age7, age8) => Math.floor(Math.sqrt(Math.pow(age1, 2) + Math.pow(age2, 2) + Math.pow(age3, 2) + Math.pow(age4, 2) + Math.pow(age5, 2) + Math.pow(age6, 2) + Math.pow(age7, 2) + Math.pow(age8, 2)) / 2);
